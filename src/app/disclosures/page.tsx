                Investing involves risk, including the potential loss of
                principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
                No investment strategy can guarantee a profit or protect against
                loss in periods of declining values.
              </p>
              <p>
                Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk.
                There can be no assurance that a specific investment or strategy
                will be suitable or profitable for a client&apos;s portfolio.

                Asset allocation and diversification strategies do not guarantee
                a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. The value
                of investments and the income derived from them may fluctuate,
                and you may receive back less than you originally invested.
