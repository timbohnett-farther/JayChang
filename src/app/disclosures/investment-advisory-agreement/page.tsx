              <p>
                The Program seeks to implement investment portfolios designed by
                investment advisors with target asset allocations based on the
                Client&apos;s financial situation, risk tolerance and time horizon.
                Using the Advisor&apos;s Platform, the Client agrees to provide
                information necessary to determine Client&apos;s financial situation,
                risk tolerance and time horizon. The Client&apos;s responses will
                determine an appropriate investment strategy for the Client&apos;s
                Account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Advisor has discretion over crafting investment strategy and
                necessary portfolio construction to meet the client&apos;s objective
                and investment profile. This may include the use of core
                investment models created and managed by Farther Asset
                Management, LLC, an affiliated company.

              13. Mediation and Binding Arbitration

              <p>
                The parties acknowledge that mediation usually helps parties to
                settle their dispute. Therefore, any party may propose mediation
                whenever appropriate through any mediation process the parties
                may agree upon.
              </p>
              <p>
                If not by mediation, except in matters for injunctive relief, any
                claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Agreement
                shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the
                then effective arbitration rules of any qualified private
                arbitration organization. The arbitration organization to hear
                the case shall be determined by the party who first initiates
                arbitration by filing a claim in accordance with the filing
                rules of the organization selected. Any judgment upon the award
                rendered pursuant to such arbitration may be entered in any
                court of competent jurisdiction over the matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                For any claim to be considered by an arbitrator(s) the claim
                must be within the statute of limitations applicable to the
                claim as if it were filed in a court of competent jurisdiction.
                Any claims, which are not received within the applicable statute
                of limitations, are deemed waived and barred. Nothing in this
                Agreement may be interpreted to limit or modify the Adviser&apos;s
                fiduciary duty to the Client or as a waiver of any right or
                remedy a Client may have under federal or state securities laws.

                The above annualized fees are negotiable and charged monthly on
                a pro-rata basis in advance. Advisory fees are based on the fair
                market value of the portfolio under management at the closing
                date of each month. In the event that the Client terminates the
                managed account between monthly billing cycles, the Client will
                receive a pro-rata refund based on the amount of time their
                account has been under management and the time remaining within
                that particular month.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Client may also incur certain charges imposed by custodians,
                and other third parties. These include transfer fees, execution
                costs, broker-dealer spreads, broker-dealer mark-ups or
                markdowns on principal transactions, administrative fees, 12b-1
                fees and other similar fees on brokerage accounts and securities
                transactions. Exchange traded funds also charge internal
                management fees, which are disclosed in the relevant fund&apos;s
                prospectus. Farther does not receive these fees or any other
                compensation from exchange traded fund&apos;s fund managers. Such
                fees are in addition to advisory fees contained in the above fee
                schedule.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ongoing use of the Program reaffirms the Client&apos;s agreement
                that Farther may charge the Client&apos;s respective account, as
                applicable. If Farther is unable to collect the advisory fee
                from the Client&apos;s account, Farther reserves the right to
                liquidate assets to pay advisory fees, or to assess the fee in
                arrears and/or terminate the Client&apos;s participation in the
                Program. Termination of any account may be undertaken at
                Farther&apos;s sole discretion. Upon termination of an account,
                assets may be liquidated as soon as practicable. Any unearned
                pre-paid fees will be calculated and refunded on a pro-rata
                basis.
