A dynasty trust, particularly one established in Nevada, can last indefinitely — allowing wealth to compound and pass to future generations without triggering estate or generation-skipping transfer taxes at each generational level. Combined with Nevada\'s zero state income tax on trust income, a dynasty trust can be one of the most powerful vehicles for preserving multi-generational wealth.',

Without a proactive plan, a liquidity event — whether a sale, IPO, or death of the business owner — can trigger substantial tax liabilities and disrupt family finances.

                  A multi-generational financial governance framework is a
                  structured set of principles, policies, and decision-making
                  processes that guide how a family manages, grows, and
                  transfers wealth across generations. It typically includes a
                  family mission statement, investment policy guidelines,
                  distribution standards, roles and responsibilities for family
                  members, and a process for resolving conflicts. We help
                  families design governance structures that balance the
                  founding generation&apos;s values with the autonomy and goals
                  of heirs.

                  access to accounts, we help families create a phased approach
                  &mdash; introducing younger generations to budgeting, then
                  investment concepts, and eventually governance participation
                  &mdash; so they are prepared to be responsible stewards of
                  the family&apos;s wealth.

                  A standard irrevocable trust typically has a defined
                  termination date based on state law (often 90 to 100 years).
                  A dynasty trust, particularly one established in Nevada, can
                  last indefinitely &mdash; allowing wealth to compound and
                  pass to future generations without triggering estate or
                  generation-skipping transfer taxes at each generational
                  level. Combined with Nevada&apos;s zero state income tax on
                  trust income, a dynasty trust can be one of the most powerful
                  vehicles for preserving multi-generational wealth.

                  Many families hold a significant portion of their wealth in a
                  single business or concentrated stock position. Without a
                  proactive plan, a liquidity event &mdash; whether a sale,
                  IPO, or death of the business owner &mdash; can trigger
                  substantial tax liabilities and disrupt family finances. We
                  help families design succession plans, diversification
                  strategies (such as exchange funds and charitable remainder
                  trusts), and buy-sell agreements that preserve wealth across
                  the transition and minimize tax exposure for the next
                  generation.
