                  Your portfolio is monitored continuously by our technology platform and
                  reviewed formally with your advisor on a quarterly basis at minimum. We
                  also conduct ad-hoc reviews whenever there is a meaningful change in your
                  life, the markets, or the tax landscape — so you are never caught off
                  guard.
