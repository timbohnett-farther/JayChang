        text: 'A revocable trust (also called a living trust) allows you to maintain control of the assets during your lifetime and can be modified or dissolved at any time. An irrevocable trust removes assets from your taxable estate, providing estate tax reduction and asset protection benefits, but cannot easily be changed once established. The right structure depends on your goals — we help families determine which trust types align with their wealth transfer and asset protection objectives.',

        text: 'Nevada offers some of the most favorable trust laws in the country. A Nevada dynasty trust can last indefinitely (no rule against perpetuities), offers a two-year asset protection window for self-settled trusts, and incurs zero state income tax on trust income when structured properly. For families in Arizona or other states, establishing a Nevada situs trust through our Arizona operations can provide meaningful tax and protection advantages that home-state trusts cannot match.',

        text: 'The current federal estate tax exemption of approximately $13.6 million per person is scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025, potentially dropping to roughly half that amount under previous law. For families with estates above the reduced threshold, proactive planning — including irrevocable trust strategies like SLATs and GRATs — can lock in the higher exemption before it expires. We help families evaluate whether accelerated gifting or trust funding makes sense given their overall financial picture.',

                  A revocable trust (also called a living trust) allows you to
                  maintain control of the assets during your lifetime and can be
                  modified or dissolved at any time. An irrevocable trust removes
                  assets from your taxable estate, providing estate tax reduction
                  and asset protection benefits, but cannot easily be changed
                  once established. The right structure depends on your goals
                  &mdash; we help families determine which trust types align with
                  their wealth transfer and asset protection objectives.

                  Yes &mdash; and we encourage it. Estate attorneys draft the
                  legal documents that implement your plan. Our role is to design
                  the trust and estate strategy, model the financial outcomes,

                  ensure your attorney, CPA, and financial plan are all working

                  The current federal estate tax exemption of approximately $13.6
                  million per person is scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025,
                  potentially dropping to roughly half that amount under previous
                  law. For families with estates above the reduced threshold,
                  proactive planning &mdash; including irrevocable trust
                  strategies like SLATs and GRATs &mdash; can lock in the higher
                  exemption before it expires. We help families evaluate whether
                  accelerated gifting or trust funding makes sense given their
                  overall financial picture.
