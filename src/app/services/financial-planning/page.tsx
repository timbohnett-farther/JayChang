                  Traditional financial plans rely on a single set of
                  assumptions: one rate of return, one inflation figure,
                  one retirement date. Reality is rarely that predictable.
                  Farther&apos;s analysis engine models your plan across
                  hundreds of market scenarios, stress-testing your strategy
                  against prolonged downturns, unexpected expenses, and changes
                  in tax law. The result is not a single number but a range of
                  outcomes and the confidence to make decisions with clarity.

                  Whether you are evaluating early retirement, considering a
                  career change, or deciding between funding a 529 plan and
                  gifting assets outright, scenario-based planning gives you the
                  framework to compare trade-offs in real time, not in

                  Absolutely. Financial planning done in isolation leads to
                  missed opportunities. We proactively coordinate with your CPA
                  on tax projections, Roth conversions, and income timing, and
                  with your estate attorney on trust structures, beneficiary
                  designations, and wealth transfer strategies. If you need
                  referrals, we can connect you with trusted specialists in
                  Arizona and Nevada.

                  Investment management focuses on building and managing your
                  portfolio. Financial planning is the broader framework. It
                  answers questions like when you can retire, how to fund
                  education, whether your insurance coverage is adequate, and
                  how to sequence withdrawals in retirement. At Farther, both
                  disciplines are fully integrated so every investment decision
                  supports your larger financial plan.
