                Investment Governance Built Around Your Mission
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-4 font-sans text-body text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed">
                Nonprofit boards are tasked with protecting and growing
                institutional assets while staying true to their organization's
                mission. That means developing a sound investment policy,
                establishing a disciplined spending policy, selecting and
                monitoring investment managers, and maintaining clear fiduciary
                documentation — all while navigating market volatility and
                evolving regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 font-sans text-body text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed">
                Most boards don't have a dedicated CIO on staff, and volunteer
                investment committee members often lack the time or
                institutional resources to manage these responsibilities
                effectively. That's where we come in. As your OCIO partner, we
                bring the same caliber of investment infrastructure used by
                large university endowments — scaled and customized for
                community foundations, private family foundations, and
                mission-driven nonprofits.

                professional oversight, disciplined process, and transparent
                reporting — so your leadership team can focus on advancing the
                mission rather than monitoring markets.
