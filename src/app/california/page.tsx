                    California is not just wealthy. It is a global center of wealth creation. With 185 billionaires,
                    a gross state product of $5.2 trillion, and unmatched ecosystems for technology, entertainment,
                    and entrepreneurship, California has become synonymous with high-net-worth success. From tech
                    executives and startup founders in Silicon Valley to entertainment professionals in Los Angeles to
                    real estate investors across the state, California creates wealth at a scale matched by no other
                    region.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But California wealth comes with a cost: a 13.3% top state income tax rate that combines with
                    federal taxes to create a 37–54% marginal tax burden for high-income professionals. For tech
                    executives with vesting RSUs, founders with concentrated stock, or any high-earner in the state,
                    California&rsquo;s tax regime fundamentally changes the math for financial planning, diversification,
                    and wealth transfer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That&rsquo;s where we come in. We help California wealth creators navigate this unique landscape—
                    maximizing after-tax wealth, optimizing equity compensation, planning for potential relocation,
                    and building strategies that account for California&rsquo;s specific rules while preserving your
                    upside. Real wealth planning for California isn&rsquo;t one-size-fits-all.

                  California&rsquo;s top marginal state income tax rate of 13.3% is among the highest in
                  the nation, making tax optimization critical. This affects everything from retirement account
                  strategy to business entity structuring to the timing of capital gains realization. For high-earning
                  executives and entrepreneurs, effective tax planning can recover hundreds of thousands of dollars
                  over a career. Our wealth strategies are purpose-built around California&rsquo;s unique tax landscape.

                  Tech equity compensation—RSUs, ISOs, NSOs—comes with complex tax implications that

                  assets. We build systematic diversification strategies that balance tax efficiency with concentration
                  risk reduction. This includes advice on exercise timing, net settlement strategies, 10b5-1 plans,
                  and coordinating with your company&rsquo;s equity plan rules. The stakes are too high for generic advice.

                  For some high-earning professionals, a Nevada relocation can create meaningful tax savings—Nevada
                  has no state income tax while California taxes worldwide income. However, tax residency is complex
                  and requires careful documentation of your intent and actions. We help clients evaluate whether
                  relocation makes sense based on their specific situation, expected retirement timeline, and
                  personal/family considerations. It&rsquo;s not right for everyone, but for some clients, it&rsquo;s transformational.
