              <p>
                TSMC&apos;s $65 billion investment in Fab 21 and the surrounding Phoenix ecosystem didn&apos;t just create jobs. It created one of the most dynamic wealth-building environments in North America. Intel&apos;s $7.87 billion CHIPS Act commitment, Microchip&apos;s expansion, Apple&apos;s supply chain investments, NVIDIA&apos;s design partnerships, and Amkor&apos;s advanced packaging facilities have all converged on greater Phoenix. For you, that means opportunity.
              </p>
              <p>
                But opportunity without planning is just exposure. Your compensation is built on equity. RSUs vesting quarterly. SERPLUS deferred compensation that won&apos;t be taxed until you separate. ESPP shares with restricted selling windows. Restricted stock units with performance conditions. Stock options with exercise deadlines. Relocation bonuses tied to multi-year employment conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                NVIDIA alone has a beta of 2.31 against the market. Your personal income concentration, your equity exposure, and your tax liability are all non-linear and non-obvious. One bad quarter doesn&apos;t just hit the stock price. It hits your cash flow, your liquidity, and your financial security. Without a plan built specifically for semiconductor and tech compensation, you&apos;re managing this blind.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71] mb-6">
                Intel&apos;s Senior Executive Retirement Plus plan is a deferred compensation structure that looks simple on paper: defer salary, get matching contributions, and access the funds later. What most advisors miss is the concentration risk, the account-by-account withdrawal sequencing, and the tax efficiency opportunities that exist within that deferral election.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                Your SERPLUS account carries counterparty risk tied to Intel&apos;s creditworthiness. Your withdrawal timing is constrained by IRS rules 409A. Your account can grow into significant wealth, but without a plan that acknowledges these constraints, you&apos;re leaving both wealth and optionality on the table.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71] mb-6">
                Intel&apos;s 401(k) plan allows after-tax contributions up to the annual IRS limit. That means you can contribute beyond the normal $23,500 employee deferral. But mega backdoor Roths require exact execution: contribution timing, immediate rollover procedures, pro-rata calculations if you have pre-tax balances.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                One misstep in the sequence and you&apos;ve just created a tax liability you didn&apos;t intend. I coordinate this annually to ensure you&apos;re maximizing tax-free growth without triggering unintended tax events.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                Intel&apos;s RSU grants vest on a standard four-year schedule with 25% annual vesting. If you&apos;ve been there for multiple grant cycles, you&apos;re likely holding significant Intel stock that&apos;s creating concentration risk. That vesting calendar needs to coordinate with your tax plan, your diversification strategy, and your overall wealth architecture. Without coordination, you&apos;re selling RSUs in the wrong tax year or missing hedging opportunities that could protect gains.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71] mb-6">
                TSMC brought hundreds of engineers, process specialists, and leaders from Taiwan to Arizona. That relocation came with significant financial incentives: relocation bonuses, housing allowances, retention bonuses tied to multi-year employment conditions. These packages create non-obvious tax implications, especially if you&apos;re foreign national or tax resident in multiple jurisdictions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                The financial planning around these packages isn&apos;t just about managing the windfall. It&apos;s about structuring it in a way that minimizes tax drag, coordinates with your equity grants and vesting schedule, and aligns with your longer-term wealth plan.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71] mb-6">
                TSMC&apos;s Arizona footprint creates supply chain stability and long-term demand visibility that&apos;s different from its Taiwan operations. That matters for your equity. TSMC&apos;s Arizona expansion is generating structural tailwinds: multi-year orders from Apple, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and others all dependent on reliable Phoenix-based production capacity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                Your equity holdings are capturing a piece of that momentum. But momentum isn&apos;t permanent, and concentration in a single company\u2014especially one with significant geopolitical leverage\u2014requires sophisticated hedging and diversification strategies.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                TSMC&apos;s three-phase Arizona build means continuous expansion, ongoing hiring, and multi-decade employment runway. For you, that means employment security. But it also means your equity grants and retention schedules are built around these phases. Understanding the timeline, the business milestones, and the resulting equity lifecycle is essential to managing your wealth efficiently.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71] mb-6">
                NVIDIA&apos;s trajectory in AI infrastructure created one of the largest wealth events for employees in a single company in recent history. RSU grants that were awarded at reasonable valuations five years ago are now worth multiples of their grant prices. For many NVIDIA employees in Arizona, that means personal net worth that&apos;s highly concentrated in a single volatile stock.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                That&apos;s not a problem by itself. But it becomes a problem when you don&apos;t have a clear plan to manage it: when you&apos;re selling at tax-inefficient times, when you&apos;re failing to diversify in a way that preserves upside, when you&apos;re not protecting yourself against downside risk.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71] mb-6">
                NVIDIA&apos;s ESPP plan allows employees to purchase shares at a 15% discount using payroll deductions. That discount is immediate value. But the execution is important: when to exercise, when to hold, when to diversify. Many employees treat their ESPP like a set-it-and-forget-it benefit, but coordinating those purchases with your overall portfolio construction, tax-loss harvesting strategy, and diversification plan can meaningfully improve your after-tax returns.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">
                I work with NVIDIA employees to execute ESPP contributions in a way that optimizes the discount benefit while managing concentration risk and tax efficiency.

                Insider blackout periods\u2014the windows when officers, directors, and other insiders can&apos;t trade\u2014are a fact of life at public companies. At NVIDIA, they constrain when you can execute your diversification plan. Quarterly earnings blackouts mean you might not be able to execute your intended sales or hedges during critical windows. That requires advance planning and strategic execution on the non-blackout dates.

                Microchip&apos;s Arizona operations employ engineers, technicians, and support staff across multiple facilities. The company&apos;s broad-based equity program makes grants available to employees at all levels, not just executives. That&apos;s valuable, but it also means your equity package likely includes a mix of RSUs, performance shares, and stock options\u2014each with different vesting schedules, tax treatments, and financial planning implications.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71] mb-6">
                RSUs are taxed as ordinary income on vesting. Stock options carry capital gains treatment, but only if you hold them long enough. Performance shares depend on the company meeting specific financial targets. Without a clear picture of your entire equity package, you can&apos;t optimize the tax treatment or execute a coherent diversification strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#5b6a71]">

                Amkor&apos;s advanced packaging and testing operations in Arizona place the company at the intersection of chip design and manufacturing.

                Amkor&apos;s public filings (Form 4 insider transactions, proxy statements, quarterly earnings) reveal patterns of insider buying and selling that can inform your own equity planning.

This is where the real value lies: seeing how your semiconductor wealth connects to your bigger life plan.
