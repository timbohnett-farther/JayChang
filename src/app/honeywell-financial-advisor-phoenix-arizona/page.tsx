                Honeywell Engineers and Executives: Your 401(k) Match Comes With a Hidden Risk.

                Honeywell&apos;s 7% employer match is among the most generous in aerospace. But it arrives as Honeywell stock — and most employees don&apos;t realize how much of their retirement is riding on one company&apos;s performance. Jay Chang helps Honeywell professionals build a complete, diversified plan.

                <p>
                  Your Honeywell employer match arrives as a generous contribution: 7% of salary for matching 8% of your contributions. But there&apos;s a critical detail most employees miss. The match is deposited directly into the Honeywell Common Stock Fund — and it stays there until you actively move it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For long-tenured employees and those who max out their contributions, this creates significant concentration risk. Twenty to forty percent of total 401(k) assets often sit in a single stock. Meanwhile, your individual investments elsewhere may further tilt your portfolio toward Honeywell shares.
                </p>

                  Jay&apos;s approach to Honeywell match strategy includes:

                  <li>Mapping your current Honeywell stock concentration across all accounts</li>
                  <li>Building a systematic reallocation plan within plan rules</li>
                  <li>Coordinating your 401(k) allocation with taxable and brokerage holdings</li>
                  <li>Planning around the 3-year vesting schedule for match contributions</li>

                Manager and Executive RSUs Require a Written Plan. Most Don&apos;t Have One.

                <p>
                  If you&apos;re a manager or executive at Honeywell, you may receive restricted stock units on top of base salary. RSUs vest on a schedule — typically 25% at one year, then 1/36th monthly over the remaining three years. Some managers elect RSUs over cash, amplifying Honeywell concentration even further.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Without a written plan, RSU vesting often becomes a surprise tax event or an unmanaged wealth windfall. Jay works with Honeywell leaders to design a comprehensive RSU strategy:

                  Honeywell rewards tenure. Employees who stay build substantial retirement savings across 401(k)s, taxable accounts, deferred compensation plans (if eligible), and Honeywell stock. When it&apos;s time to retire — or plan toward that transition — the decisions become intricate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The core questions require detailed planning:

                  <li>When should you actually retire — and how does that timing affect healthcare and Social Security?</li>
                  <li>How do you bridge the healthcare coverage gap between retirement and Medicare at 65?</li>
                  <li>How do you structure withdrawals and conversions to minimize lifetime tax liability?</li>
                  <li>How do you build a tax-efficient wealth transfer strategy for heirs?</li>
