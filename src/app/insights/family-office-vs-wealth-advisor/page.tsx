    question: 'How much do you need for a family office?',
    answer:
      'A single-family office (SFO) typically requires $50 million to $100 million in investable assets to justify the cost of dedicated staff, legal entities, and infrastructure. Multi-family offices (MFOs) lower the threshold to roughly $10 million to $25 million by sharing resources across several families.',

    question:
      'What is a family office alternative for families with $5M to $20M?',
    answer:
      'A comprehensive wealth advisor is the most common and effective family office alternative for families in this range. A well-structured advisory relationship provides coordinated investment management, tax strategy, estate planning, insurance review, retirement planning, and business exit guidance — the same core services a family office delivers — at a significantly lower cost.',

    question:
      'Is there a family office in Dallas for families under $20 million?',
    answer:
      'While traditional family offices in Dallas generally serve families with $50 million or more, a comprehensive wealth advisor can deliver family-office-caliber service for families with $1 million to $20 million. The advisor coordinates across investments, taxes, estate planning, and insurance, functioning as a financial quarterback at a fraction of the family office cost.',

                The phrase &ldquo;family office&rdquo; carries a certain weight. It conjures images of a private team of financial professionals — investment managers, tax attorneys, estate planners, and personal assistants — all working exclusively for a single ultra-wealthy family. For decades, the family office has been the gold standard for managing complex financial lives. And for families with $100&nbsp;million or more in investable assets, it often makes sense.

                But what about the family with $5&nbsp;million, $10&nbsp;million, or $20&nbsp;million? You may have a liquidity event behind you, a successful business generating significant cash flow, or a combination of real estate, retirement accounts, and taxable investments that demands sophisticated coordination. You need more than a basic financial advisor — but do you really need a family office? In most cases, the answer is no. What you need is a{' '}

                What a Family Office Actually Is
              </h2>
              <p className="font-sans text-[17px] text-[#1C2B3A] leading-[1.8] mb-6">
                A family office is a private organization created to manage the financial and personal affairs of a wealthy family. There are two primary types. A single-family office (SFO) serves one family exclusively, employing a dedicated team of professionals — often including a chief investment officer, tax specialists, estate attorneys, accountants, and administrative staff. A multi-family office (MFO) spreads those same resources across several families, reducing cost per family while still delivering a high level of personalized service.
              </p>
              <p className="font-sans text-[17px] text-[#1C2B3A] leading-[1.8] mb-6">
                The scope of a family office typically extends well beyond investments. A full-service family office may provide investment management across public and private markets, tax planning and preparation, estate and trust administration, bill payment and cash-flow management, insurance procurement and oversight, philanthropic advisory and foundation management, real estate acquisition and management, family governance and next-generation education, concierge services such as travel coordination and household staff management, and cybersecurity and privacy protection. That breadth is precisely what makes a family office so appealing — and so expensive.

                Cost is where the family office conversation gets real. Running a single-family office means employing full-time staff, maintaining office space, licensing software, engaging outside counsel, and managing regulatory compliance. The numbers add up quickly. Below is a comparison of the typical minimums and annual costs across the three models.

                For a family with $10&nbsp;million in investable assets, a single-family office would consume 10 to 30 percent of the portfolio in annual operating costs alone — before any investment fees. A multi-family office is more efficient but still costly. A comprehensive wealth advisor, by contrast, delivers the core planning and investment services at a fraction of the cost, typically through a transparent asset-based fee that declines as the portfolio grows.

                The gap between a family office and a top-tier wealth advisory firm has narrowed considerably over the past decade. Technology, institutional partnerships, and the rise of independent advisory platforms have made it possible for a single advisory team to deliver services that once required an entire private organization. Here is how the two models compare across the most common planning areas.

                The services that remain exclusive to a family office — bill payment, household staff management, concierge, and cybersecurity — are genuinely useful but are also the easiest to outsource independently. A family can hire a personal assistant, engage a cybersecurity firm, and use a bill-pay service without wrapping all of it in a multi-million-dollar family office structure. The high-value financial services — investment management, tax planning, estate strategy, and retirement projections — are precisely where a{' '}

                When a Family Office Does Make Sense
              </h2>
              <p className="font-sans text-[17px] text-[#1C2B3A] leading-[1.8] mb-6">
                There are situations where a family office is the right choice. If your investable assets exceed $50&nbsp;million, the cost of an SFO becomes a smaller percentage of the portfolio and may be justified by the depth of dedicated attention you receive. Extreme complexity — such as managing operating businesses across multiple countries, coordinating trusts in several jurisdictions, or overseeing a large private foundation — can require the kind of daily operational management that only a fully staffed family office can provide.
              </p>
              <p className="font-sans text-[17px] text-[#1C2B3A] leading-[1.8] mb-6">
                Families that want a dedicated team working exclusively on their affairs — not shared across other clients — may also find an SFO compelling. The same is true for families with acute privacy or security concerns, such as those in the public eye or in industries where physical and digital security are paramount. If you need a chief investment officer on staff, a dedicated controller reviewing every transaction, and a team of professionals who report only to you, a family office is the structure that supports that level of infrastructure.
              </p>
              <p className="font-sans text-[17px] text-[#1C2B3A] leading-[1.8] mb-6">
                For everyone else — and that includes the majority of affluent families — the cost-to-benefit ratio of a family office simply does not pencil out. The services you actually need can be delivered more efficiently through a modern advisory relationship.

                <li className="font-sans text-[17px] text-[#1C2B3A] leading-[1.8]">
                  <strong className="font-semibold">Is my financial complexity truly beyond what a top-tier advisory firm can handle?</strong> Multi-entity structures, concentrated positions, charitable foundations, and cross-state planning are all within the capability of a modern wealth advisory practice.

                  <strong className="font-semibold">Am I willing to manage the family office itself?</strong> An SFO is, in effect, a small business. Someone has to hire the staff, oversee the operations, manage vendors, and ensure compliance. Many families underestimate the management burden.

                <li className="font-sans text-[17px] text-[#1C2B3A] leading-[1.8]">
                  <strong className="font-semibold">What is the total cost — and what would I do with the savings?</strong> The difference between a family office and a comprehensive advisor can be $500,000 to $2&nbsp;million per year. Invested wisely, that difference compounds into meaningful additional wealth over a decade.
