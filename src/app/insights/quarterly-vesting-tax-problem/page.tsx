            <h2>The Quarterly Vesting Structure</h2>
            <p>
              At Intel, NVIDIA, Microchip, and most major tech companies, restricted stock units (RSUs) vest on a quarterly schedule. Typically, you receive a multi-year grant vesting over four years, with a cliff (often 12 months) and then equal quarterly vesting over the remaining three years.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means: if you receive a $200,000 four-year grant, you vest nothing year one, then $50,000 in quarters 2 - 5 (year two), $50,000 in quarters 6 - 9 (year three), and $50,000 in quarters 10 - 13 (year four). That is four quarterly vests per grant, per year.
            </p>
            <p>
              But most engineers do not have a single grant vesting. They have overlapping grants. A typical engineer might have:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Grant 1: vesting $12,000 per quarter (six quarters remaining)</li>
              <li>Grant 2: vesting $8,000 per quarter (four quarters remaining)</li>
              <li>Grant 3: vesting $6,000 per quarter (eight quarters remaining)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              That totals to $26,000 in quarterly vests, or $104,000 annually, spread across four quarterly taxable events. Each vest is a separate taxable event with separate withholding.
            </p>
            <p>
              For senior engineers or at higher-paying companies, the numbers are much larger. A principal engineer at NVIDIA might have $150,000+ per quarter in combined RSU vests, totaling $600,000 annually.
            </p>

            <h2>The 22% Supplemental Withholding Problem</h2>
            <p>
              When an RSU vests, your employer withholds federal income tax at the supplemental tax rate, which is a flat 22% for most recipients. This is not based on your actual tax bracket - it is a standard rate the IRS allows for supplemental income like bonuses and vesting equity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the problem: your actual marginal tax rate is probably higher than 22%. If you earn $250,000 in base salary, your federal marginal rate is 32%. Add state tax (Arizona is 2.5%, California is 9.3%), and your total marginal rate might be 32% - 40%.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: Q1 RSU vest of $25,000. Withholding: 22%, or $5,500. You owe actual tax: 32% federal + 2.5% Arizona = 34.5%, or $8,625. The gap: $3,125 underwitheld in Q1 alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              That $3,125 gap is not made up in Q2, Q3, or Q4. Each quarter has the same problem. By the end of the year, with four quarterly vests of $25,000 each, you have accumulated an underwithholding gap of approximately $12,500.
            </p>

            <h2>The Compounding Problem</h2>
            <p>
              The underwithholding problem compounds throughout the year because each vest happens independently. You do not make up the Q1 gap in Q2 - the Q2 vest happens with the same 22% withholding, creating another gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              By Q4, you have not only accumulated underpayment from earlier quarters, but Q4 vests push your total annual income even higher. If Q4 includes a year-end bonus or a larger RSU vest, your marginal tax rate might spike above 37% (for federal), creating even larger per-quarter gaps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Real scenario: engineer earning $200,000 base, receiving $100,000 in Q1-Q3 RSU vests (roughly $33,000 per quarter), plus a $50,000 year-end bonus and $100,000 in Q4 RSU vests. Here is the withholding shortfall:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Q1 - Q3: $33,000 per quarter x 22% = $7,260 withheld per quarter. Actual rate 35% = $11,550. Gap: $4,290 per quarter x 3 = $12,870.</li>
              <li>Q4: $50,000 bonus + $100,000 RSU = $150,000. Withholding at 22% on RSU = $22,000 (bonus may withhold at 22% too, or 37%). Actual tax at 37% rate = $55,500. Gap: $33,500.</li>
              <li>Total annual gap: approximately $46,370.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This engineer will file taxes in April 2027 expecting a large underpayment and will owe $46,370 plus interest and potential penalties for substantial underpayment.
            </p>

            <h2>Why the April Surprise Happens</h2>
            <p>
              The problem is not discovered until April when you file your tax return because the withholding happens automatically throughout the year, and most people do not reconcile cumulative withholding against expected total tax liability until they file.
            </p>
            <p>
              You receive paychecks with consistent withholding, RSU vests with consistent 22% supplemental withholding, and you do not aggregate these into a year-end projection. By April, you are facing a $30K-$50K tax bill you did not anticipate, and you are scrambling to pay it or face payment plan arrangements with the IRS.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes this worse: the problem is completely preventable. With one hour of planning in January, you can map the entire year and eliminate the surprise.
            </p>

            <h2>The Solution: January Planning and Monthly Pay-As-You-Go</h2>
            <p>
              The solution is three steps, all completed in January before any vesting occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 1: Project Total Compensation for the Year</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Calculate your expected total income for 2026:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Base salary: $200,000</li>
              <li>Expected bonus: $60,000</li>
              <li>Expected RSU vests: all grants, all quarters. $400,000 (from your grant schedule)</li>
              <li>Total 2026 income: $660,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can get this information from your grant schedule in your company&apos;s equity management system (Fidelity, E*TRADE, etc.). List every grant, every quarter&apos;s vesting schedule, and sum it up.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 2: Calculate Your Actual Marginal Tax Rate</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              On $660,000 of total income (assuming standard deduction and no other major deductions):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Federal income tax: Approximately $195,000 (29.5% effective rate on this income level in 2026)</li>
              <li>State income tax: Approximately $16,500 (2.5% Arizona flat tax)</li>
              <li>FICA (Social Security + Medicare): Approximately $20,000 (wages only, not investment income)</li>
              <li>Total 2026 tax: Approximately $231,500</li>
              <li>Effective rate: 35% of total income</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Your actual marginal rate on the last dollar of income is approximately 35% - 37% federal (you are in the top bracket) plus state tax. Use 37% - 39% as your projected marginal rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Step 3: Calculate the Withholding Gap and Adjust</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Expected withholding throughout the year: base salary withholding + RSU withholding at 22% + bonus withholding at 22%.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Base salary withholding: Approximately $60,000 (employer withholds regularly)</li>
              <li>RSU withholding: $400,000 x 22% = $88,000</li>
              <li>Bonus withholding: $60,000 x 22% = $13,200</li>
              <li>Total withholding: $161,200</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Expected total tax: $231,500. Expected withholding: $161,200. Gap: $70,300.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will underpay by $70,300 if you do nothing. To eliminate the gap, you need an additional $70,300 in withholding throughout the year.
            </p>

            <h2>Adjusting Withholding: The Practical Options</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Option 1: Increase W-4 Withholding</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              File a new W-4 with your employer and request additional federal withholding. You can direct your employer to withhold an extra $5,858 per paycheck (for semi-monthly pay, 12 paychecks per year). This will add approximately $70,300 annually and eliminate the gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the simplest approach. You file the W-4, withholding increases automatically, and you are done. The downside: you lose access to that money throughout the year (it goes to taxes instead of your bank account).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Option 2: Make Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You can file Form 1040-ES and make four quarterly estimated tax payments ($17,575 per quarter, or adjust based on when vests occur). The payments are due April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15. This gives you more control over timing and cash flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The downside: you have to remember to make the payments, and they require proactive action. Most people do not do this because they forget or do not know the dates.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Option 3: Hybrid Approach</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Increase W-4 withholding by $3,000 per paycheck (adding $36,000 annually), then file quarterly estimated payments for the remaining $34,300. This spreads the burden: your regular paycheck handles most of it, and quarterly payments handle the rest.
            </p>

            <h2>Real Example: Microchip Engineer with Evergreen Grants</h2>
            <p>
              Sarah is a senior engineer at Microchip earning $180,000 base, expecting a $40,000 bonus, and holding multiple evergreen grants vesting at different quarterly schedules. Her total expected RSU value for the year: $320,000. Total 2026 comp: $540,000.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her marginal tax rate: 35% (federal + state). Total expected tax: $189,000.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current withholding: base salary $36,000 (built into regular paychecks), RSU vests $70,400 (22% x $320,000), bonus $8,800 (22% x $40,000). Total: $115,200.
            </p>
            <p>
              Withholding gap: $189,000 - $115,200 = $73,800.
            </p>
            <p>
              In January, Sarah files a new W-4 requesting additional withholding of $6,150 per paycheck (semi-monthly, 24 paychecks). This adds $147,600 annually - more than she needs, but safe to ensure she does not underpay.
            </p>
            <p>
              By April, when she files her 2026 return, her total withholding is approximately $262,800, exceeding her $189,000 tax liability. She receives a refund of approximately $73,800. She has eliminated the April surprise entirely.
            </p>

            <h2>NVIDIA Engineers and Stacked Income Events</h2>
            <p>
              NVIDIA employees face a particularly acute version of this problem because the company combines quarterly RSU vesting with ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan) purchases. When an NVIDIA engineer exercises ESPP shares in the same quarter that RSUs vest, they get stacked income recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: NVIDIA engineer receives $50,000 in Q4 RSU vest. They also exercise ESPP in Q4, receiving $30,000 in gain (purchase discount). The same quarter has $80,000 in income - but withholding on RSUs is 22%, and ESPP gain is not always withheld adequately. The gap in Q4 alone might be $20,000+.
            </p>
            <p>
              NVIDIA engineers should review their ESPP exercise schedule and try to stagger ESPP purchases away from major RSU vests. Or, increase W-4 withholding significantly in Q4 (and leave it in place permanently).
            </p>

            <h2>The Record-Keeping Piece</h2>
            <p>
              Once you have set up withholding adjustments in January, keep a spreadsheet tracking each quarterly vest:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Date of vest</li>
              <li>Number of shares vested</li>
              <li>Fair market value on vest date</li>
              <li>Gross income recognized</li>
              <li>Withholding at 22%</li>
              <li>Your expected tax at your marginal rate</li>
              <li>Shortfall or overage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This spreadsheet keeps you honest. As you progress through the year, you can see cumulative withholding versus expected tax. If you are on track, you can relax. If there is a growing gap, you can adjust your W-4 mid-year (you can adjust W-4 withholding at any time, not just January).
            </p>

            <h2>Why April Is Too Late</h2>
            <p>
              Some engineers rationalize: "I will just pay the gap in April with my tax refund from my W-2 withholding or from a prior-year carryforward." This is poor planning. If you owe $40,000 to the IRS in April, that is $40,000 you did not have available throughout the year for savings, investments, charitable giving, or emergencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, the IRS imposes underpayment penalties if your quarterly withholding and estimated tax payments fall below safe-harbor thresholds (generally, you need to pay either 90% of your current year tax or 100% of your prior-year tax as you go, not all in April). Paying in April can trigger penalties, even if you pay the full amount owed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plan in January, adjust withholding, and pay as you earn. This is the only sensible approach.
            </p>

            <h2>The Broader Lesson</h2>
            <p>
              This problem extends beyond quarterly RSU vesting. Any engineer receiving equity compensation in multiple forms (RSUs, bonuses, ESPP, options) faces compounding withholding problems if they do not aggregate and plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fix is always the same: January projection, marginal rate calculation, withholding adjustment, year-round tracking. One hour in January saves tens of thousands in April.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thought</h2>
            <p>
              Quarterly RSU vesting is not the problem - it is a standard, tax-efficient form of compensation. The problem is the mechanical withholding at 22% on income that is actually taxed at 35%+. The $30K-$50K April surprise is not inevitable. It is the result of not planning in January. Map your entire year in January, calculate your actual tax liability, adjust your withholding, and eliminate the problem. Most engineers ignore this until April. Smart ones handle it in January.
