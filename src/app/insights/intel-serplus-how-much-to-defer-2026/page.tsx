            <h2>What Is SERPLUS?</h2>
            <p>
              Intel SERPLUS is a nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan that allows eligible employees (typically directors and above) to defer compensation beyond the limits of the company&apos;s 401(k) plan. The plan operates as an unfunded, unsecured general obligation of Intel - meaning the money is notionally set aside in your account, but it is not segregated or held in trust. Intel holds approximately $3.3B in total SERPLUS obligations across all participants, and that pool grows as eligible employees contribute.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mechanics are straightforward: you elect to defer a portion of salary, bonus, or restricted stock unit value into SERPLUS. The deferred amount is invested in notional investments (you choose among a set of mutual funds or investment options), and the balance grows tax-deferred until you specify a distribution date. When you retire or terminate, or at a specified future date, you receive the distribution, and the deferred income becomes taxable.
            </p>
            <p>
              SERPLUS is tax-advantaged deferral - you defer current taxation on the income, allowing decades of compounding before tax is due. For a director earning $300,000 and deferring 20%, that is $60,000 of income deferred annually, saving approximately $22,000 in immediate federal tax (37% marginal rate). Over five years, the deferral compounds tax-free, potentially creating an additional $15,000 - $20,000 of tax-deferred growth.
            </p>

            <h2>The Unsecured Nature: Intel&apos;s Financial Position in 2026</h2>
            <p>
              Here is the critical distinction: SERPLUS is an unsecured obligation. If Intel filed for bankruptcy, SERPLUS participants would be general creditors, ranked behind secured creditors (banks, bondholders) but ahead of equity holders. Your SERPLUS balance would be at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Intel has undergone dramatic restructuring in recent years. The company posted a $16.1B net loss in fiscal 2024, down from profitability in 2023. The company has cut its workforce from approximately 108,000 employees to a target of 75,000 - a 30% reduction. It announced an $200B fab expansion program, then scaled it back dramatically. The company borrowed $20B+ in debt to fund operations and restructuring.
            </p>
            <p>
              This does not mean Intel is in imminent danger. The company remains one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, with substantial assets, revenue, and intellectual property. But the financial trajectory has shifted. The company that was once the most profitable chipmaker in the world is now consolidating, cutting, and borrowing to maintain market position.
            </p>

            <h2>Why the Risk-Reward Calculus Has Changed</h2>
            <p>
              In 2015, Intel was highly profitable and facing no existential threats. Deferring significant compensation into SERPLUS made sense - you captured tax-deferred growth on a large, stable corporation with minimal financial risk. In 2026, that calculus has shifted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tax benefit of deferral is still real - you save 37% in current federal tax on deferred compensation. But you are now deferring that compensation into an unsecured plan at a company that is materially more risky than it was five years ago. The trade-off is: capture tax savings now, but expose that future distribution to credit risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              The question is not whether Intel will go bankrupt tomorrow - no one knows that. The question is whether the tax savings from deferral are worth the incremental credit risk. For some people, the answer is yes. For others, the answer is no.
            </p>

            <h2>Framework for Deciding: Four Key Questions</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>1. What is Your SERPLUS Balance Relative to Your Net Worth?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The most important metric is: what percentage of your total net worth is exposed to Intel credit risk? If you have a $400,000 SERPLUS balance and $2M in total net worth, that is 20% of your wealth riding on Intel&apos;s solvency. That is material risk. If you have $400,000 in SERPLUS and $5M in total wealth (8% of your portfolio), the risk is lower.
            </p>
            <p>
              A reasonable rule of thumb: do not exceed 25% of your total net worth in SERPLUS and other unsecured deferred comp plans combined. If your current SERPLUS is already above 25%, consider reducing new deferrals.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. When Do You Plan to Distribute?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              When you defer, you also specify a distribution date - typically retirement, termination, or a future fixed date. The longer the deferral, the longer your money is at credit risk. If you plan to retire in three years, a SERPLUS deferral exposes that money to risk for three years. If you plan to work for 15 more years, the exposure is much longer.
            </p>
            <p>
              For near-term retirees, minimizing SERPLUS exposure makes sense because the risk period is short and you need the funds soon. For those 15+ years from retirement, SERPLUS can be more attractive if Intel&apos;s credit risk is manageable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. What Is the Tax Benefit vs. Future Tax Rates?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The tax benefit of deferral depends on two rates: your current marginal rate and your expected tax rate when distributed. If you are in the 37% federal bracket now and expect to be in the 24% bracket in retirement, the deferral saves 13% between the two years - meaningful, but not transformative.
            </p>
            <p>
              If tax law changes materially (rates rise, long-term capital gains treatment changes, or other variables), the future tax rate on your distribution might be higher or lower than you expect. This adds uncertainty to the calculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compare the certain tax savings now (37% if that is your bracket) against the uncertain tax cost in the future. The difference is the net tax benefit of deferral. If that is 10 - 15%, is it worth the credit risk?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. What Are the Alternatives?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Intel&apos;s 401(k) plan supports a mega backdoor Roth - you can contribute up to $72,000 per year in after-tax contributions, convert to Roth, and all future growth is tax-free and protected by ERISA. This money is held at Fidelity (Intel&apos;s plan custodian), segregated from Intel&apos;s balance sheet, and protected by FDIC/SIPC.
            </p>
            <p>
              For high earners, the mega backdoor Roth is almost always better than SERPLUS on a tax-adjusted basis: you get tax-free growth (better than tax-deferred), the money is protected (no credit risk), and it is simpler. Maximize the mega backdoor Roth first, then evaluate SERPLUS with remaining savings capacity.
            </p>

            <h2>The SERPLUS Concentration Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Many Intel employees have significant concentration in Intel stock itself - either from stock purchase plans, old option grants, or vested RSUs that employees have chosen to hold. On top of that, they have deferrals in SERPLUS, which is also unsecured Intel obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
              This creates double exposure: your wealth is concentrated in Intel equity (stock price risk) and Intel credit risk (SERPLUS balance risk). If Intel has a significant problem, both positions suffer simultaneously. This is a risk concentration problem that warrants attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you already have 30%+ of your net worth in Intel stock, be very cautious about large SERPLUS deferrals. Spreading risk across multiple asset classes (diversified stock portfolio, bonds, real estate, etc.) is more prudent than concentrating in a single company.
            </p>

            <h2>Real Analysis: A Director at Current Deferral Levels</h2>
            <p>
              Consider a director at Intel earning $250,000 in base salary + $100,000 in annual bonus = $350,000 base comp. The director also receives approximately $200,000 in annual RSU vesting, for total annual comp of $550,000. The director is in the 37% federal marginal tax bracket plus 3% Arizona state tax = 40% combined rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, the director defers $100,000 annually into SERPLUS (from salary and bonus). The existing SERPLUS balance is $400,000 (four years of accumulated deferrals). The director&apos;s total net worth is approximately $1.8M (home $800K, 401k/IRA $400K, Intel stock $300K, other investments $300K).
            </p>
            <p>
              The director&apos;s SERPLUS balance represents 22% of his net worth - near the 25% threshold. He plans to retire in 10 years. The tax benefit of deferral is approximately 40% - 28% (expected retirement bracket) = 12% net tax savings on deferred compensation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should he continue deferring $100,000 annually? The analysis:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Continuing deferrals grows his SERPLUS balance to approximately $1.4M by retirement (assuming 5% annual growth). At retirement, that represents 30 - 35% of his projected net worth, assuming continued accumulation elsewhere.</li>
              <li>The tax benefit of the deferral (12% per year) compounds to meaningful savings over 10 years - approximately $80,000 - $100,000 total tax savings across all deferrals.</li>
              <li>But the credit risk exposure is growing. If Intel faces credit problems, a $1.4M SERPLUS balance at risk becomes more concerning.</li>
              <li>The alternative: contribute $50,000 to the mega backdoor Roth (tax-free, protected) and $50,000 to a taxable brokerage account (tax-efficient, diversified). This is more conservative and spreads risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A reasonable approach: reduce SERPLUS deferrals from $100,000 to $50,000, maximize mega backdoor Roth at $72,000, and invest the remaining surplus in a taxable account. This captures some of the SERPLUS tax benefit while diversifying risk and protecting a larger portion of savings in ERISA-protected accounts.
            </p>

            <h2>Reviewing Existing SERPLUS Balances</h2>
            <p>
              If you already have a large SERPLUS balance, you cannot easily undo it - the money is already deferred. But you can evaluate your distribution elections. Many employees set distributions to "termination of employment" or a fixed future date years away. Review that election and consider whether moving up the distribution date makes sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a $500,000 SERPLUS balance and plan to work another 12 years, that $500K is exposed to Intel credit risk for 12 years. If you could move the distribution date to age 60 or 62 (just a few years away), you reduce the risk exposure period and access the money sooner.
            </p>
            <p>
              This requires careful analysis with a tax advisor - accelerating distributions has tax and withholding implications - but it is worth evaluating if your SERPLUS balance is large and concentrated.
            </p>

            <h2>SERPLUS in Context: Not a Problem, But a Risk to Manage</h2>
            <p>
              To be clear: SERPLUS itself is not a bad plan. The tax benefits are real. The company is not on the verge of bankruptcy. But the risk-reward has shifted materially in the past five years. An employee who deferred aggressively in 2018 (when Intel was most profitable) made sense. An employee deferring aggressively in 2026 should evaluate the trade-off carefully.
            </p>
            <p>
              The protected alternative - mega backdoor Roth contributions at $72,000 annually into a segregated, FDIC/SIPC-protected account - should take priority. Once you have maximized that, evaluate SERPLUS with a clear-eyed view of Intel&apos;s current position and your own risk tolerance.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thought</h2>
            <p>
              Deferring compensation is a valuable tax strategy, but it only works if the company survives and pays you. At Intel in 2026, with the company undergoing significant restructuring and debt increases, the risk profile has changed. Evaluate your SERPLUS deferrals in the context of your total net worth, your risk tolerance, and the available alternatives. The mega backdoor Roth should be your first choice for tax-advantaged savings. SERPLUS should be a secondary strategy, limited to amounts that do not exceed 25% of your net worth.
