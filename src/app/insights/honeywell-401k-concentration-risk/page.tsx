              Honeywell&apos;s 401(k) employer match is reported as 87.5% of the first 8% of eligible compensation, contributed in Honeywell Common Stock Fund shares (based on publicly available plan information as of 2025; verify with your employer). For an engineer earning $150,000, that&apos;s roughly $10,500 in matching contributions per year. But here&apos;s the problem: that match arrives as Honeywell stock, and it stays there unless you deliberately act to diversify it away.
            </p>

          <AnimateOnScroll>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">How the Concentration Builds</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The mechanics are straightforward. Honeywell deposits its match directly into the Honeywell Common Stock Fund (HCSF), a concentrated pool of HON shares. You see this contribution hit your account statement. It feels automatic and passive. That&apos;s the danger.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Over 10 years of employment at Honeywell, that match compounds. An engineer receiving $10,000 per year in matching contributions has accumulated $100,000 in HCSF. If Honeywell stock appreciates 6% annually (below its historical average), that $100,000 becomes $180,000. Now you have $180,000 in a single stock within your 401(k).
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That&apos;s only the employer match. Many engineers also purchase Honeywell stock directly through the 401(k) stock purchase plan or through personal brokerage accounts. A 20-year Honeywell career can easily result in $300,000-$500,000 in total HON holdings—far beyond any reasonable concentration threshold.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              By retirement, your 401(k) looks like this: 50-60% Honeywell stock, 20% bonds, 10% other equities, 10% cash. Your taxable brokerage account has personal purchases of Honeywell stock. Your net worth is 30-50% Honeywell. You&apos;re not diversified. You&apos;re concentrated.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">The 3-Year Vesting Schedule and Timing Risk</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Honeywell&apos;s employer match vests on a three-year schedule: one-third per year. This is a retention incentive. It also creates a timing risk that many employees overlook.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you&apos;re planning a career transition—a jump to a startup, a move to a different company, early retirement—the vesting schedule matters. If you leave Honeywell after two years, you lose one-third of three years of match. You forfeit roughly $10,000-$20,000 in company contributions. That&apos;s a significant financial consequence of job transition.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              More broadly, the vesting schedule creates a subtle trap: you become less willing to consider other opportunities because you&apos;re waiting for match to vest. That&apos;s a sunk-cost fallacy. The match has been earned. Whether it&apos;s vested is irrelevant to whether you should stay or leave.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Plan accordingly. If you&apos;re considering a departure, understand the vesting consequences and make a deliberate choice. Don&apos;t let the vesting schedule dictate your career decisions.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">The Fix: Diversify Within the 401(k)</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The straightforward solution is to rebalance your Honeywell 401(k) away from concentration. Most 401(k) plans, including Honeywell&apos;s, allow you to reallocate existing balances. Log into your Fidelity account (Honeywell&apos;s plan administrator), find the investment menu, and redirect your Honeywell Common Stock Fund balance into other investment options.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You might move 50% of your HCSF balance into a diversified equity index fund, 30% into bonds, and 20% into other options. This isn&apos;t a sale. It&apos;s a reallocation. No tax is triggered (401(k) reallocations are tax-free). No sale commission. Just a shift in how your existing money is allocated.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But reallocation is only half the solution. The second half is preventing future concentration. Once you&apos;ve diversified your existing HCSF balance, you need a plan for future employer match.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              When your next employer match arrives, it will again appear in HCSF by default. Instead of letting it accumulate, systematically rebalance quarterly. Move one-quarter of each match contribution into diversified investments immediately. Over time, new match contributions will automatically rebalance across your chosen allocation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This transforms your 401(k) from a concentration vehicle into a disciplined diversification engine. Each quarter brings fresh match that gets immediately rebalanced. Concentration risk steadily declines.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Coordinating RSU Sales With 401(k) Reallocation</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Many Honeywell professionals also receive RSUs. If you&apos;re managing Honeywell RSU concentration simultaneously with 401(k) concentration, you need a coordinated strategy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The goal is to reduce total Honeywell exposure across both accounts while managing tax efficiency. You might accelerate RSU sales in a low-income year (sabbatical, career transition) and simultaneously rebalance 401(k) holdings. Or you might stagger them: diversify 401(k) this year, then execute a multi-year RSU selling plan over the next two years.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The point is: don&apos;t treat 401(k) concentration and RSU concentration as separate problems. They&apos;re part of the same concentrated-Honeywell problem, and they need a unified solution that accounts for tax consequences and your career timeline.
