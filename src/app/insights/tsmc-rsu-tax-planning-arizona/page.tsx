              TSMC compensation packages are among the most complex in the semiconductor industry. When you combine base salary, annual bonuses, and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), you&apos;re looking at a total compensation structure that can easily exceed $350,000 annually for mid-to-senior engineers. But complexity creates opportunity—and risk. Most TSMC engineers in the Phoenix area don&apos;t have a systematic plan for managing the tax events triggered by RSU vesting, which means they&apos;re leaving money on the table and potentially facing surprise tax bills at the end of the year.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">How TSMC RSU Awards Work</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              TSMC&apos;s equity compensation program is built on Restricted Stock Units—a promise of company stock that vests over a multi-year schedule. Unlike options, RSUs are concrete: you&apos;re guaranteed to receive shares, not just the right to buy them. TSMC typically uses a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff, meaning you don&apos;t receive anything for the first 12 months, and then shares begin to vest quarterly or semi-annually thereafter.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The key distinction is that TSMC, as a company, manages the equity program. Shares are delivered through a trustee, withholding is calculated at vesting, and the entire infrastructure is designed to protect both the company and the employee. But that infrastructure doesn&apos;t account for your individual tax situation.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">The Tax Event at Vesting</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Here&apos;s where things get real. When an RSU vests, the fair market value (FMV) of those shares on the vesting date is treated as ordinary income. Not capital gains. Not investment income. Ordinary income, taxed at your full marginal rate—federal, state, and self-employment combined.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For a TSMC engineer earning $180,000 to $350,000+ annually, federal marginal tax rates land in the 32–37% bracket. When you add Arizona state income tax (up to 4.5% for high earners) and any applicable self-employment taxes, your all-in rate can easily exceed 40% without planning.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              TSMC&apos;s payroll system typically withholds 22% (federal tax withholding) plus Arizona state withholding on the vesting event. If your total tax obligation is 40% and TSMC only withheld 22%, you now owe the difference on April 15th or through estimated payments. For an engineer vesting $50,000 per year, that &apos;s $18,000 withheld and $20,000 actually owed—a gap of $2,000 per quarter that catches many people off guard.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">What Arizona Residency Means for Former California Residents</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A significant portion of TSMC&apos;s Phoenix engineering team relocated from California, where top earners faced a 13.3% state income tax rate. Arizona&apos;s top rate is 4.5%—a dramatic difference. But tax planning for former California residents requires understanding the exact timing of residency changes and source-of-income rules.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              California-sourced income (income earned while a California resident) remains taxable to California even after you move to Arizona. So if you worked in California in January, moved to Arizona in February, your January income is still California-taxable. RSU vesting dates matter enormously. If your RSU vests on the date you cross the state line, or if you have overlapping income from California work, you may owe California tax even though you&apos;re now an Arizona resident.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Documentation is essential: a clear record of your residency date, your last California work day, and a robust understanding of when your income was earned—not just when it was paid. Many engineers treat their move as a simple address change. Smart planning treats it as a major tax event.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Building a Vesting Calendar and Tax Projection</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The foundation of any RSU tax plan is a complete vesting calendar. You need to know, month by month and quarter by quarter, exactly when shares will vest, how many shares, and at what estimated FMV. TSMC doesn&apos;t always make this transparent—you&apos;re often told &ldquo;you&apos;ll vest shares quarterly over four years,&rdquo; but the specifics are buried in the equity system.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Pull your equity statement from TSMC&apos;s system. Document every upcoming vesting date and tranche. Then project what your income will be for the year. If you&apos;re expecting $200,000 in salary, $50,000 in bonus, and $30,000 in RSU vesting, you&apos;re looking at $280,000 in total taxable income—and your withholding from paychecks and RSU events needs to account for that full number.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Once you have that projection, you can model your estimated tax liability, calculate the gap between what will be withheld and what you&apos;ll owe, and make quarterly estimated payments if necessary. You can also identify opportunities to shift income into lower-tax years if you&apos;re planning a sabbatical, career transition, or other change.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">The Hold vs. Sell Decision</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              When RSUs vest, you immediately own TSMC stock. The question is: should you hold it or sell it?
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Holding is an active investment decision, not a passive default. When you hold, you&apos;re betting that TSMC stock will outperform your other investment options. You&apos;re also concentrating your wealth: if TSMC represents 20-30% of your liquid net worth, a significant drop in the stock price hits your financial plan directly.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Many TSMC engineers argue they have an informational edge—they understand the company&apos;s competitive position better than the market does. That may be true. But informational edge doesn&apos;t eliminate concentration risk. A 20-30% concentration threshold is reasonable for someone with genuine conviction. Beyond that, you&apos;re not betting on TSMC; you&apos;re betting your entire financial security on it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you do sell, timing matters. Selling immediately after vesting locks in the FMV as your cost basis, so any future appreciation is clean long-term capital gain (held more than one year). Selling after a one-year hold generates long-term capital gains rates (currently 15-20% for high earners), versus ordinary income rates on the vesting event itself.
