              If you&apos;re an engineer at NVIDIA, your RSU grants have likely created extraordinary wealth. Over the past decade, NVIDIA stock has compounded at rates that would make most financial advisors speechless. But extraordinary wealth creates an extraordinary problem: concentration risk. Many NVIDIA employees find themselves with 50%, 70%, even 90% of their liquid net worth in a single stock—the company they work for. That&apos;s not a strength. It&apos;s a significant vulnerability dressed up as a success story.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">What Is Concentration Risk?</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Concentration risk is when a disproportionately large share of your wealth sits in a single asset. For most investors, that asset is real estate (your primary home). For NVIDIA employees, it&apos;s company stock.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Concentration risk becomes dangerous when it&apos;s compounded by correlation. If your wealth is concentrated in NVIDIA stock, and your income also depends on NVIDIA (your job), and your future earnings potential also depends on NVIDIA (your career), you&apos;ve triple-concentrated your risk. A single bad quarter could simultaneously destroy your net worth, your job, and your future income. That&apos;s not investing. That&apos;s financial recklessness disguised as conviction.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Concentration risk isn&apos;t about pessimism. It&apos;s not about doubting NVIDIA. It&apos;s about recognizing that no single asset, no matter how strong, should carry the entire weight of your family&apos;s financial security.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">How Much NVDA Is Too Much?</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Traditional portfolio theory suggests that no single stock should represent more than 5-10% of a diversified portfolio. For a $2 million net worth, that means $100,000-$200,000 in any single stock. For a $5 million net worth, $250,000-$500,000.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But NVIDIA employees often sit far outside those ranges. An engineer with $2 million in total net worth and $1.5 million in NVIDIA stock is 75% concentrated. Someone with $5 million and $4 million in NVIDIA is 80% concentrated. These aren&apos;t edge cases. They&apos;re common.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you&apos;re at 50%+ concentration in NVIDIA, you have a problem that needs solving. If you&apos;re above 70%, you have an urgent problem.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">The Case for Holding</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              There are legitimate reasons to hold NVIDIA stock beyond your diversified portfolio. You work at the company. You understand its competitive position at a level the market may not fully appreciate. You have visibility into roadmaps, partnerships, and strategic direction that are months ahead of public information.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That&apos;s called informational edge. It&apos;s real. If you genuinely believe that NVIDIA will outperform the market over the next decade—that AI demand will remain inelastic, that competition will fail to materialize, that margins will hold—then holding 20-30% of your liquid net worth in NVIDIA stock is reasonable. You&apos;re betting on your own conviction and your own knowledge.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Holding 70-90%? That&apos;s not conviction. That&apos;s inertia.

          <AnimateOnScroll>
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">The Case for Diversifying</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Diversification gets derided by true believers. &ldquo;That&apos;s for people who lack conviction.&rdquo; &ldquo;Diversification is for people who own mediocre stocks.&rdquo; These statements are wrong.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Diversification isn&apos;t about doubting NVIDIA. It&apos;s not pessimistic. It&apos;s about acknowledging that the future is uncertain, that probabilities exist, and that your job as a financial planner is to protect your family&apos;s security while maintaining upside potential.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              NVIDIA is an extraordinary company. But companies face headwinds: competition intensifies, markets commoditize, regulations change, leadership transitions occur. If any of those events reduce NVIDIA&apos;s stock price by 30-50% (a correction that&apos;s entirely survivable for a well-diversified portfolio), your concentrated portfolio suffers a severe drawdown.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Selling 50% of your NVIDIA stock over a planned two-year period doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ve &ldquo;lost faith.&rdquo; It means you&apos;ve decided that your family&apos;s financial security is more important than your portfolio&apos;s return on a single stock.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">The Framework Jay Builds</h2>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you have concentration risk, here&apos;s the framework I use to address it.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>First, define your maximum concentration threshold.</strong> For most high-income earners, I recommend 25-35% as the absolute ceiling. That&apos;s still a significant bet on NVIDIA. It&apos;s enough to participate in upside if your convictions are right. But it&apos;s not so concentrated that a 30% correction destroys your plan. If you&apos;re above that threshold, you need a plan to reduce.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Second, establish a systematic selling schedule.</strong> You don&apos;t sell all at once. Emotional decisions create tax disasters. Instead, commit to selling a fixed percentage quarterly or semi-annually over 12-24 months. If you have $4 million in NVIDIA and want to reduce to $1.5 million, sell $625,000 per quarter for two years. The predictability removes emotion.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Third, apply tax-efficiency rules.</strong> Don&apos;t sell shares with the lowest cost basis first. That maximizes your tax bill. Prioritize selling RSUs that vested long ago and now have a high cost basis relative to current price. Use tax-loss harvesting in other accounts to offset gains. Coordinate large sales with low-income years if possible. The goal is to minimize tax drag on the diversification process.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong>Fourth, reinvest into a diversified strategy.</strong> When you sell NVIDIA, where does the money go? Not into a checking account. Not into other single stocks. Into a diversified portfolio: low-cost index funds, individual bonds, maybe some alternative investments. The point is to replace concentration with balance.
            </p>
