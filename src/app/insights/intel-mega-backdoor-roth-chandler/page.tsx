   Intel&apos;s 401(k) plan is one of the most feature-rich retirement plans available to private sector employees. Most engineers focus on maxing out their pre-tax contribution ($24,500 for 2026) and capturing the company match. But that&apos;s leaving an enormous amount of wealth on the table. Intel&apos;s plan allows for something called the &ldquo;mega backdoor Roth&rdquo; - a strategy that lets you contribute an additional $47,500 per year into a Roth account, growing completely tax-free. Over a 15-year career, that compounds to more than $1 million in tax-free retirement savings.

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">What Is the Mega Backdoor Roth?</h2>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   The IRS allows total annual contributions to a 401(k) plan up to $72,000 for 2026 (plus an extra $7,500 for catch-up contributions if you&apos;re 50+). Most people know about the $24,500 employee deferral limit - that&apos;s the traditional pre-tax contribution. They know about the employer match. But there&apos;s a third category: after-tax contributions.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   Here&apos;s how it works. Intel&apos;s plan allows you to contribute after-tax dollars (using money you&apos;ve already paid personal income taxes on) up to the $72,000 annual limit. If you contribute $24,500 in pre-tax deferrals and Intel matches $7,000, you can contribute an additional $40,500 in after-tax money. Then, immediately, you convert those after-tax contributions into a Roth account. The conversion itself isn&apos;t taxable - you already paid tax on the money. And from that point forward, everything grows tax-free.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   That&apos;s the mega backdoor Roth. It&apos;s not a loophole. It&apos;s not aggressive. It&apos;s an explicit strategy baked into the tax code and supported by the IRS.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Why This Matters at Intel&apos;s Income Levels</h2>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   An Intel engineer earning $250,000 or more annually is in a completely different financial situation than someone earning $120,000. At $250K+, you&apos;re already maximizing your pre-tax 401(k). You likely max out your backdoor Roth IRA ($7,000). You probably have additional savings beyond those accounts.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   The mega backdoor Roth fills a gap. It lets you put another $30,000 to $40,000 per year into a tax-advantaged account. Over 15 years of career growth at Intel, assuming 6% annual returns, that&apos;s roughly $1 million in tax-free growth. Not tax-deferred. Tax-free. In retirement, you pull that money out and owe nothing to the IRS.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   Compare that to investing in a regular taxable brokerage account. The same $500,000 in contributions grows to $1.2 million, but you owe capital gains tax on the $700,000 in gains. At 15-20% federal capital gains rates, that&apos;s $105,000-$140,000 in taxes due. The mega backdoor Roth saves you six figures.

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">How to Set It Up</h2>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   The process involves four critical steps, and they must be executed in the right order.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   <strong>Step 1: Max out your pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions.</strong> For 2026, contribute $24,500 to either traditional pre-tax deferrals, Roth deferrals, or a combination. Complete this before you move to after-tax contributions.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   <strong>Step 2: Elect after-tax contributions.</strong> Log into your Intel 401(k) account (typically through Fidelity, Intel&apos;s plan administrator). Look for the after-tax contribution election. Specify the amount you want to contribute after-tax - up to the $72,000 limit minus your pre-tax deferrals and employer match. For most engineers, this is $35,000-$40,000 per year. Update your paycheck elections to spread this across the year.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   <strong>Step 3: Execute the in-plan Roth conversion.</strong> After-tax contributions accumulate in a separate subaccount. Quarterly (or whenever it makes sense based on Fidelity&apos;s process), request an in-plan Roth conversion. This converts your after-tax balance to Roth. There&apos;s no tax consequence because you&apos;ve already paid tax on the money. Fidelity handles the mechanics.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   <strong>Step 4: Avoid the pro-rata rule.</strong> This is critical. The pro-rata rule exists if you have traditional, non-Roth IRA balances. If you have a traditional IRA with $100,000 and you attempt a backdoor Roth conversion, the IRS treats all your IRA balances as one pool. A portion of the conversion becomes taxable. To avoid this, either eliminate traditional IRA balances (through rollovers into your 401(k) if the plan allows) or ensure all conversions are clean. Consult with your tax advisor on this point.

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#333333] mt-12 mb-6">Coordinating With SERPLUS</h2>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   Many Intel engineers also participate in SERPLUS (Strategic Employee Retirement Plan), an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan. SERPLUS allows executives to defer additional income, reducing current taxes. On the surface, this seems similar to the mega backdoor Roth. But there&apos;s a crucial difference.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   SERPLUS is an unsecured company liability. Your deferred compensation sits on Intel&apos;s balance sheet, backed only by Intel&apos;s promise to pay. The mega backdoor Roth, by contrast, sits in a 401(k) account at Fidelity, fully segregated from Intel&apos;s assets and protected by ERISA.
  </p>
  <p className="text-[#5b6a71] leading-relaxed mb-6">
   In Intel&apos;s current financial environment - facing competitive pressure and restructuring - that distinction matters. Both vehicles have merit, but they serve different purposes. SERPLUS might be appropriate for executives with very high income who can tolerate counterparty risk. For most engineers, the mega backdoor Roth into Fidelity deserves priority. It&apos;s fully protected, tax-efficient, and guarantees your savings aren&apos;t at risk if Intel faces hardship.
