                TSMC&apos;s expansion into the United States has brought thousands of Taiwanese engineers to Arizona, with the fab operations headquartered in Phoenix. The relocation represents an extraordinary opportunity - higher salaries, proximity to cutting-edge technology, and a chance to build something significant in the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                But this relocation also introduces a layer of financial complexity that many people underestimate. As someone transitioning from Taiwan to the United States, you face tax and reporting obligations that have no parallel in Taiwan. The U.S. taxes you on worldwide income, requires reporting of foreign financial accounts, and maintains information exchange agreements with Taiwan that increase the likelihood of compliance.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This article walks through the critical financial and tax planning items you must address as a TSMC engineer relocating from Taiwan to the United States.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">FBAR Filing: The Most Important Requirement You Have Never Heard Of</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you maintain any financial accounts in Taiwan - a savings account, a brokerage account, or a retirement pension fund - you must file a report to the U.S. Treasury called the FBAR (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts).
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The threshold is simple: if the aggregate balance of your foreign financial accounts exceeds $10,000 at any point during the calendar year, you must file FinCEN Form 114 by April 15 of the following year. This is a criminal penalty provision, meaning the penalties are severe.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For non-willful violations (mistakes), the penalty is up to $12,909 per account per year. If the IRS determines the violation was willful - meaning you knew you were required to file and deliberately did not - the penalties are much larger: 50% of the account balance at the time of maximum violation, or $129,090, whichever is greater. These are not tax adjustments. These are additional penalties on top of the tax you owe.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The FBAR must be filed electronically with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), not with the IRS. Many taxpayers miss this filing entirely because they do not understand it is separate from their income tax return. Your CPA or tax software may not prompt you for it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The definition of "financial accounts" is broad. It includes bank accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, brokerage accounts, mutual funds, stock accounts, bond accounts, commodities accounts, and retirement accounts. If you have a Taiwan Labor Pension account, that is a reportable account.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">FATCA Form 8938: A Second Layer of Reporting</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In addition to the FBAR, you may need to file IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) if your foreign assets exceed certain thresholds.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The thresholds are: $50,000 for a single filer at year end, or $75,000 for a single filer at any point during the year. If you are married and filing jointly, the thresholds are $100,000 at year end or $150,000 at any point during the year.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The definition of "specified foreign financial assets" is similar to the FBAR definition but includes some additional items like foreign stock holdings and foreign pension funds. Unlike the FBAR, Form 8938 is filed with your U.S. tax return.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The penalty for failing to file Form 8938 is $10,000 per violation, with the potential for additional penalties if the IRS requests the form and you do not provide it. After an IRS request, the penalty can increase to $50,000.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">Taiwan Labor Pension: Portability and Taxation</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you have contributions in the Taiwan Labor Pension system (Lao Bao), you need to understand how this will be taxed and whether you can transfer it to the U.S.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                First, the bad news: there is no mechanism to directly roll your Taiwan Labor Pension into a U.S. retirement account like an IRA. The accounts are not compatible under U.S. tax law, and Taiwan does not have a reciprocal agreement with the U.S. Social Security Administration that would allow portability.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Second, the contributions you made to Taiwan Labor Pension are likely to be subject to U.S. tax. Once you become a U.S. person (green card holder or resident alien for tax purposes), all income from worldwide sources is subject to U.S. taxation. This includes investment income earned in your Taiwan pension account. However, contributions you made to the account while you were a Taiwan resident and working for a Taiwan employer may be treated differently depending on the timing of your move.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The best approach is to work with a cross-border tax specialist to understand the specific tax treatment of your pension contributions and to explore whether you should withdraw or leave the funds in the account. Some people choose to leave the funds and let them grow without touching them until retirement, when they can plan the taxation of the withdrawal. Others choose to withdraw the funds early and invest them in U.S. accounts where they have more control.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">U.S. Tax Residency: The Substantial Presence Test</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The U.S. determines tax residency using two primary tests: the green card test and the substantial presence test. If you have been granted an employment-based green card or L-1A visa, you are likely a U.S. resident for tax purposes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you are on an H-1B visa or another non-immigrant status, you are not automatically a resident for tax purposes, but you may become one under the substantial presence test. The test is mechanical: count the days you are physically present in the U.S. during the current year (each day counts as 1), plus one-third of the days from the prior year, plus one-sixth of the days from the year before that. If the total is 183 days or more, you are a resident for tax purposes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Once you are a U.S. tax resident, you must report all worldwide income to the IRS, including any Taiwan-sourced income, Taiwan investment income, and Taiwan rental income if applicable. This is different from many other countries, which use a residency-based or source-based system.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The consequence is that if you continue to own rental property in Taiwan or receive interest and dividends from Taiwan bank accounts, that income is U.S. taxable once you become a resident. You cannot simply ignore it because it is foreign income.
              </p>

            <section className="mb-12">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">Worldwide Income Reporting</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                As a U.S. resident for tax purposes, you must report:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-8 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-3">
                <li>Wages earned in the U.S.</li>
                <li>Any Taiwan-sourced wages if you continue to work remotely for a Taiwan entity.</li>
                <li>Interest income on Taiwan bank accounts.</li>
                <li>Dividend income on Taiwan investments.</li>
                <li>Rental income from Taiwan property if you own real estate.</li>
                <li>Capital gains on the sale of Taiwan investments or property.</li>
                <li>Any other Taiwan-sourced income.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you have income that is already taxed by Taiwan, you may be eligible for a foreign tax credit on your U.S. return, which reduces your U.S. tax liability. However, calculating the foreign tax credit correctly requires careful documentation and often professional tax preparation.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The key is to gather documentation of any Taiwan taxes paid and provide that to your U.S. tax preparer. Without this documentation, you will not receive credit and will effectively pay tax twice on the same income.
              </p>

            <section className="mb-12">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">The Taiwan - U.S. Tax Treaty: What It Does Not Cover</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many people assume that because the U.S. has tax treaties with most countries, there must be one with Taiwan. This is incorrect. The United States does not have a comprehensive income tax treaty with Taiwan.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This means there is no treaty mechanism to prevent double taxation on Taiwan-source income. If you earn money in Taiwan and Taiwan taxes it, and you become a U.S. resident and the U.S. also taxes it, you have no treaty relief. Your only option is the foreign tax credit.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The lack of a treaty also means that tax incentives, exemptions, or reduced rates in Taiwan may not be recognized by the U.S. This makes Taiwan-U.S. cross-border planning more challenging than planning with countries that have comprehensive treaties with the U.S.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section className="mb-12">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">Currency Considerations and Family Obligations</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many TSMC engineers who relocate to the U.S. maintain family obligations in Taiwan, including supporting aging parents or other family members. These obligations are often denominated in New Taiwan Dollars (NTD).
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you are earning U.S. dollars in Phoenix but sending money back to Taiwan in NTD, you need to be aware of currency fluctuations. The NTD/USD exchange rate has varied between 29 and 33 NTD per dollar in recent years. A monthly obligation of 100,000 NTD could translate to $3,000 to $3,450 USD depending on the exchange rate.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For budgeting purposes, many people use a mid-market rate plus a small buffer to account for currency volatility. Your bank will charge a slightly higher rate than the mid-market rate when you convert dollars to NTD and transfer money. Shopping for the best transfer rates (companies like Wise often offer better rates than traditional banks) can save hundreds of dollars per year.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                From a tax perspective, currency conversions do not trigger income tax, so sending money back to Taiwan is not a taxable event. However, if you buy Taiwan currency and later sell it, or if you hold Taiwan-denominated investments that appreciate, those gains may be taxable.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section className="mb-12">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">Social Security: No Totalization Agreement</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The United States has Social Security totalization agreements with many countries, which allow workers to credit contributions from multiple countries toward their Social Security benefits. Unfortunately, the U.S. does not have a totalization agreement with Taiwan.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This means two things: First, the contributions you made to Taiwan Labor Pension do not count toward U.S. Social Security benefits. Second, you may owe Social Security taxes on wages earned in Taiwan, and Taiwan may also assess its own payroll tax.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you work for TSMC and earn U.S. wages, you will pay U.S. Social Security and Medicare taxes (15.3% self-employment tax or 7.65% if paid by employer). These contributions will count toward your U.S. Social Security benefits.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                If you continue to have Taiwan-source income (either from TSMC in Taiwan or from a separate arrangement), Taiwan may still require Social Security contributions on that income. Coordinating this with your U.S. tax preparer is critical to avoid overpaying.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">Your Financial Planning Checklist</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Here is a summary checklist of actions to take as you relocate from Taiwan to the U.S.:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-3">
                <li>Determine your visa status and tax residency timeline. Understand when you will be considered a U.S. tax resident.</li>
                <li>Document all Taiwan bank accounts and financial accounts. List the account numbers, institution names, and approximate balances.</li>
                <li>Make a note of the Taiwan Labor Pension account details and any contributions you have made. Consult with a cross-border tax specialist about treatment.</li>
                <li>If you have any Taiwan-source income (rental property, dividends, or other income), document it carefully so you can report it on your U.S. return.</li>
                <li>Set up a system to track days of physical presence in the U.S. versus days outside the U.S. This is critical for the substantial presence test if you are on an H-1B visa.</li>
                <li>Establish a U.S. bank account and address shortly after arriving. This establishes your U.S. residency for other purposes (driver&apos;s license, voter registration, etc.).</li>
                <li>Find a CPA or tax professional who has experience with cross-border taxation and FBAR/FATCA filing. Do not rely on generic tax software.</li>
                <li>In the year you become a U.S. resident, file Form 8938 (if assets exceed thresholds) and FinCEN Form 114 FBAR (if foreign financial accounts exceed $10,000). Do both, even though they overlap.</li>
                <li>Plan for currency transfers and understand the rates offered by various transfer services.</li>
                <li>Consult with an immigration attorney if you are planning to eventually obtain a green card. Tax planning and immigration planning must be coordinated.</li>
              </ol>

            <section className="mb-12">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#333333] mb-4">Why Professional Help Matters</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The financial complexity of relocating from Taiwan to the U.S. is significant. Unlike a relocation within the U.S., where the main tax issue is state income tax, relocating from a foreign country involves federal reporting requirements, worldwide income taxation, and potential penalties of $12,900 or more for simple mistakes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The cost of hiring a CPA or tax attorney who understands cross-border taxation is an investment that pays for itself many times over. A single missed FBAR filing can result in a $12,909 penalty even if you did not owe any additional taxes. A missed Form 8938 can trigger audit attention.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                As a TSMC engineer earning a high salary, you are a higher-audit-risk individual. The IRS has automated systems that flag taxpayers with significant foreign assets, foreign income, or complex return items. Taking time to file correctly from the start is far better than dealing with an audit later.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Your relocation to the U.S. is an exciting opportunity. TSMC&apos;s expansion into Arizona is creating world-class engineering jobs and is a significant investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. By taking the time to understand and manage the financial and tax aspects of your relocation, you can focus on your career and your life without worrying about compliance issues down the road.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The key is to start early, document everything, and work with professionals who understand cross-border taxation. Doing so will ensure that you are compliant with U.S. tax law, maximize any tax credits you are eligible for, and minimize your lifetime tax burden.
