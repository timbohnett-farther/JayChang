              Why the Backdoor Roth Still Works in 2026
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Traditional Roth IRA contributions have income limits. For 2026, a single filer earning more than $161,000 cannot make a direct Roth IRA contribution. For married filing jointly, the limit is $240,000. These phase-outs are designed to prevent high earners from using Roth accounts, and for many successful professionals, they create a barrier to tax-free growth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The "backdoor" Roth IRA is a legal, IRS-approved strategy that circumvents these income limits. It works by using an intermediate step: contribute money to a traditional IRA (which has no income limits), then immediately convert the balance to a Roth IRA. The conversion itself has no income limits. What makes this strategy work is a technicality in tax law that treats the contribution and conversion as separate transactions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Executing a backdoor Roth correctly requires understanding the pro rata rule, the interaction with existing pre-tax IRA balances, and specific filing requirements. A mistake in execution can result in unexpected tax bills and lost opportunities for tax-free growth.
            </p>

              Step 1: Confirm You Have No Pre-Tax IRA Balances
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              This is the most critical step and the place where most backdoor Roth attempts fail. The IRS applies the "pro rata rule" to all of your traditional IRA accounts combined - across every institution, every account type. If you have even $1,000 in pre-tax IRA balances, the pro rata rule applies to your entire backdoor Roth conversion.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Pre-tax IRA balances include traditional IRAs, SEP-IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and any other non-Roth retirement accounts you maintain. Many high-income professionals have SEP-IRA or SIMPLE IRA balances from prior business activities or self-employment income. If you do have pre-tax balances, you must address them before executing a backdoor Roth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              To confirm your IRA balances, log into all financial institutions where you hold IRAs. Look for traditional IRA, SEP-IRA, and SIMPLE IRA accounts. The values you are looking for are the pre-tax, non-Roth balances. Roth IRA balances do not trigger the pro rata rule and can be ignored for this purpose.

              Step 2: Roll Pre-Tax IRA Balances Into Your 401(k)
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              If you discovered pre-tax IRA balances in Step 1, you have an option: roll them into your employer&apos;s 401(k) plan (assuming your plan allows incoming rollovers, which most do). This is sometimes called a "custodial rollover" or "direct rollover." The effect is to move the pre-tax balance out of the IRA system and into a qualified retirement plan, where the pro rata rule does not apply.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Call your IRA custodian (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, etc.) and request a direct rollover of your entire pre-tax IRA balance to your 401(k). The custodian will send the funds directly to your 401(k) plan administrator. This avoids the 60-day rollover deadline issue and avoids creating a taxable event. Once the rollover completes, confirm with your 401(k) plan administrator that the balance has been received and deposited.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              This rollover does not affect your ability to make a backdoor Roth. It simply clears the pro rata issue so you can proceed cleanly.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-12 text-gray-900">
              Step 3: Contribute $7,500 to a Traditional IRA
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              This is your base backdoor Roth amount for 2026 (adjust if 2026 contribution limits have increased). Open a traditional IRA at a major custodian if you do not already have one, or contribute to an existing traditional IRA. The key is that this is the account you will convert in Step 4.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              You should specify that this contribution is "non-deductible." This is important for tax filing purposes. You are not claiming a tax deduction for this contribution because you are over the income limits.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Fund the account with $7,500 in cash. Do not contribute appreciated securities or other assets. Keep the money in cash or a money market position to minimize tax complications.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-12 text-gray-900">
              Step 4: Convert the Full Balance to a Roth IRA
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Timing is critical here. Perform this conversion as close as possible to Step 3 - ideally within days, certainly within the same week. The reason is tax liability: the longer the money sits in the traditional IRA before conversion, the more opportunity for taxable growth or gains to occur. If the $7,500 earns $10 in interest between contribution and conversion, you will have a small taxable gain to report.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Contact your IRA custodian and request a conversion of the entire traditional IRA balance to a Roth IRA. Most custodians can process this electronically or through their online platform. The conversion itself is not a taxable event at the moment it occurs - it is merely a change in account type. The tax liability (if any) is reported when you file your return.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Some custodians allow you to convert to an existing Roth IRA; others require a new Roth IRA. Either approach is fine. The key is that the entire $7,500 (plus any minimal earnings) is converted to a Roth account that is now yours.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 mt-12 text-gray-900">
              Step 5: File Form 8606 With Your Tax Return
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              This is the documentation step, and it is mandatory. Form 8606 (Nondeductible IRAs) reports the non-deductible contribution and the conversion to the IRS. When you file your tax return for the year in which you made the contribution and conversion, attach Form 8606 to your return.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              On Form 8606, you will report: the amount of the non-deductible contribution ($7,500), the amount converted, and the cost basis of the contribution. Because you funded the traditional IRA with after-tax dollars and converted it all to a Roth, your tax basis is $7,500 and your taxable gain is $0 (assuming minimal earnings).
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              File this form even if you expect no tax liability. Failure to file Form 8606 when required can result in IRS penalties. If your tax professional prepares your return, provide them with documentation of the contribution and conversion amounts.

              Common Mistakes That Derail Backdoor Roths
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <strong>Mistake 1: Forgetting About SEP-IRA Balances.</strong> You executed a backdoor Roth last year without remembering that you have a $50,000 SEP-IRA from consulting income five years ago. When you file this year&apos;s return, the IRS applies the pro rata rule and suddenly 80 percent of your $7,500 conversion is taxable. This is the most common error. The solution is a 401(k) rollover of the SEP-IRA balance before attempting the backdoor Roth the next year.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <strong>Mistake 2: Not Filing Form 8606.</strong> Some people execute the contribution and conversion but forget to file Form 8606 when preparing their tax return. The IRS has no record of the transaction and may assess taxes on the conversion as if it were a taxable event. Always file Form 8606.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <strong>Mistake 3: Recharacterizing Instead of Converting.</strong> These are different transactions. A recharacterization changes the type of contribution retroactively; a conversion moves money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. For a backdoor Roth, you always want a conversion, not a recharacterization. This is often a matter of language with your custodian - confirm they are processing a "conversion."
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <strong>Mistake 4: Converting When Pre-Tax IRA Balances Exist.</strong> The pro rata rule triggers automatically if any pre-tax IRA balances exist on December 31 of the year in which you convert. Even if you plan to roll them to a 401(k) in January, the pro rata rule has already applied. Roll pre-tax balances to a 401(k) before year-end if you are executing a backdoor Roth in the same year.

              The Backdoor Roth Is Separate From the Mega Backdoor
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              There is another strategy called the "mega backdoor Roth" which uses after-tax contributions to your 401(k) plan (separate from the $7,500 traditional IRA contribution). The limit for this is much higher - $72,000 for 2026 - but it is only available if your plan allows after-tax contributions and in-plan conversions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The $7,500 backdoor Roth described in this article is a separate opportunity. A high earner can do both: contribute $7,500 to a traditional IRA, convert it to a Roth, and separately contribute $72,000 in after-tax funds to the 401(k) and convert those to a Roth (if the plan allows). Combined, this allows over $79,000 in annual Roth contributions for high earners.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Check with your 401(k) plan administrator to confirm whether your plan allows after-tax contributions and in-plan Roth conversions. Not all plans do.

              Why This Strategy Still Matters in 2026
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Over a 30 or 40-year horizon, the compounding within a Roth account can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax-free wealth. For a high earner who would otherwise have no way to access Roth accounts, the backdoor Roth is one of the most valuable tax planning tools available.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Execute it correctly, file the proper forms, and the backdoor Roth becomes a straightforward way to access Roth accounts regardless of your income.
